# What's a design system?

This project was made as part of the Udacity [Front-end nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011). The project rubic had a lot of requirments that I followed for this, like responsiveness using media queries, only use HTML and CSS, use Flexbox at least twice and CSS grid as least twice throughout the project, etc.
